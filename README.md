Accessing the dark web securely involves a combination of tools and cautious practices. Here's a breakdown of the steps to take: 
1. Prepare Your Environment
Use a Dedicated Device: If possible, use a separate computer or device that's not connected to your primary home network or used for sensitive tasks, minimizing potential risks to your main system.
Consider a Secure Operating System: A Linux-based operating system like Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) can enhance security by running from a USB drive and leaving no trace on your hard drive.
Update Software: Ensure your operating system, Tor Browser, and any security software are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
Close Unnecessary Apps: Close other applications to reduce potential vulnerabilities or entry points for malicious actors. 
2. Utilize Security Tools
Virtual Private Network (VPN): Connect to a reputable VPN service before using Tor to mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, adding a layer of privacy and preventing your ISP from easily detecting Tor usage.
Tor Browser: Download and install the Tor Browser from the official Tor Project website. Tor anonymizes your browsing by routing your traffic through multiple encrypted servers. 
3. Configure Tor Browser
Set Security Level to "Safest": In Tor Browser's security settings, set the security level to "Safest" to disable JavaScript and other potentially risky browser features, even if it might affect some website functionality.
Consider Disabling JavaScript Completely: For maximum security, consider disabling JavaScript entirely in Tor Browser's settings, according to DOT Security. 
4. Cautious Dark Web Navigation
Use Dark Web Search Engines and Directories: Use specialized dark web search engines like DuckDuckGo, Ahmia, or Torch, and directories like The Hidden Wiki to find .onion sites, notes Norton.
Verify Links: Exercise caution when clicking on links, especially those found on forums or unverified sources. Try to verify links through multiple sources before visiting a site.
Avoid Downloading Files: Be extremely cautious about downloading files from the dark web as they may contain malware.
Minimize Personal Information: Do not share any personal information on dark web sites or forums.
Do Not Engage in Illegal Activity: The dark web is associated with illegal activities, so avoid engaging in any criminal behavior. 
Important Note: Accessing the dark web carries inherent risks. Even with precautions, you might encounter illegal content, scams, malware, or other threats. Browse responsibly and at your own discretion.

if you wanna search the Internet incognito mode does not hide your search history from the Internet provider or government. if you actually want your search engine to be 100% private
then instead, use a VPN. Quick note avoid any VPNs that you don't have to pay monthly or weekly for because it would most likely be a scam.
